        <p class="p-about">I'm a wannabe coder. I always have been.  When I was a kid, my dad brought us home an Atari 800XL.  My siblings and I instantly became obsessed.  When we got tired of playing the games that came with it, we decided that we should just start making our own. Really, all we were able to do was make some noises and draw some cool animations to the screen<strong> but we had fun doing it</strong>.  Here, in 1983, started a lifelong obsession with programming that was almost just out of reach. I tried teaching myself all of the languages available to me: C, Turbo C++, QBasic, Java.  Finally, I made it to college.  But still, I found the cirriculum to be too diffifcult, I failed out of differential equations and chemistry.  I gave up.  Then Last year, I had a friend tell me about Epicodus. </p>
